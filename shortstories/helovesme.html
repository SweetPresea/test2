            The wind runs through my body and flutters my hair. The sun shines on me and places its warm kisses on my head. I look around, but there’s nothing other than a lonely color. Green. Green everywhere. There might be trees, towering like towers, yet there are no flowers like me. I am unique in this garden, which used to bring me joy. Not anymore. What’s the point of being special if the person I love the most doesn’t see it? <br>

I remember when I met Elio as if it had been yesterday, although several years have passed. He was just a kid with a dazzling smile. The first time he lay eyes on me, the purest excitement rushed through his veins. He called his mother to tell her that a beautiful rose had bloomed among a canvas of grass. No one in his family was very interested in the news, only him. That day, he knelt in front of me. It was a wondrous sensation, that of his breath against my petals. He promised that he would take care of me. <br>

I was the happiest flower in the universe whenever I was with Elio. He used to shower my petite body with the right amount of water and endless affection. He would tell me about his day and laugh, though there were times in which he complained about things that had passed. I was his friend, his confidant, but I craved for more. It didn’t take me long to realize that I was madly in love. <br>

He was always tall for his age. Slim. Baby-blue eyes I could drown in. He used to caress my leaves with the softness of his hands. He enchanted me with the way he moved, the way he looked at me, and the way he told me secrets. It was as if, in this garden, it were just the two of us. The rest of the world vanished and that was fine. 

I loved that sweet boy. A part of me still believes that sweet boy loved me. <br>

However, time started leaving its marks on Elio. It was a blessing and a punishment because it beautified him, but it also took him away from me. Poor Elio, he was always busy with homework or chores. He didn’t have much time to be with me. I understood and respected that. But just because I understood and respected it doesn’t mean I didn’t miss his touch and the melodic sound of his voice, or how they both thrilled me. 

The truth is that I’ve grown up, too. Maybe he stopped loving me with the same passion as when he was little. Did I stop being pretty enough for him? In the past, I thought such a thing was ludicrous! I was always the one who provided color to his life and, therefore, I was convinced that he would never cast me aside. 

I was wrong. <br>

It’s been so long since I last saw him. I’ve lost count of the days I’ve spent alone in this awful garden. I need him to come back and show me that he hasn’t forgotten me. 

A man comes out of the house. I recognize him in an instant. Tall, slim, baby-blue eyes. More handsome than ever. Elio! You cannot imagine how much I have missed you! He kneels in front of me like on our first encounter. But something isn’t right. A strange fragrance envelops his body, it’s impregnated in his clothes. It is the detestable scent of another woman… There’s no need to be worried. He came back for me, which means I’m still his favorite. Whoever that nobody is, she can’t compete against all the history the two of us share. 

“Perfect,” he whispers as his gaze is fixed on me. Two beacons of light in the dark. <br>

His voice is far more captivating than I remembered. I blush a little at the compliment. I blush a lot when his fingers embrace me. This feeling is indescribable. I hope he never lets me go. Despite the age and distance, he has not stopped being my Elio. I am whole again.

I love this sweet boy. This sweet boy—Ouch! <br>

So this is what it feels like to die with a broken heart.
