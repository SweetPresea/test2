            When I was twelve years old, I met Sylvie. As I ambled along the seashore searching for seashells, I saw her standing there. A girl my age, yet we were nothing alike. Sylvie was a creature straight out of a fairy tale. Her dark hair flowed like waves. Her eyes were blue like the water. I was too shy to approach her then, but we wouldn’t be apart for long. <br>

The next day, she was at my school. The most spectacular feeling coursed through my veins when she sat by my side. The nervous glances we exchanged were the ones that ignited our friendship. I loved having her here there because it meant I didn’t have to keep eating lunch alone. I finally had someone to pass notes in class, someone to play with and laugh. The two of us, so different, were inseparable. Until the bell rang. Sylvie would never hang out with me after school, and I had no idea why. Haunting thoughts plagued my mind. Maybe she had other friends she liked better. Maybe she spent time with me out of pity. Whenever I asked her what she had been doing, she would change the subject. It would have been infuriating if she hadn’t had the melodious voice of a mermaid.

One day, nonetheless, I decided to find out the truth. Sylvie was the most important person in my life. Was it selfish to want her all for myself? Was that so wrong? <br>

She strode across the streets as if she was in a rush; I had to be careful not to lose her from sight. A few minutes after being at her heels, I was out of breath. But turning back was no longer an option because Sylvie had arrived at her destination. The beach where I first became aware of her existence.

I had never seen such a bright smile as the one Sylvie dedicated to the hypnotic ocean. Then, she kneeled down and started digging with determination. Her pristine hands were covered in wet sand, yet she didn’t mind. She pulled something out of the ground… A seal’s skin. No bones. No flesh. No blood. Only skin.

And she put that skin on. <br>

You must think I’ve lost my mind, but this is the unvarnished truth. My best friend, Sylvie, who I held dear to my heart, turned into a seal and jumped into the sea with unfathomable freedom. She vanished in a couple of seconds as I was left behind, jaw on the ground. <br>

I shadowed her again the next day. And the one after that. And so on for over three months. Sylvie would always do the same thing: Go to the beach, retrieve the seal's skin, put it on, and swim off. At first, I thought it was a spectacle not short on incredible. She really was straight out of a fairy tale! When did that fascination turn into hatred toward the seal’s skin? It was because of that thing that she refused to be with me after school. If I got rid of what allowed her to transform, she would have no choice but to remain human. She would stay with me, even after the bell had rung.

The morning after I’d had that marvelous idea, I missed school. Instead, I went to Sylvie’s favorite spot on the beach. Then, I kneeled down and started digging with determination. My sweaty hands were covered in wet sand, yet I didn’t mind. This was for the sake of our friendship. So when I found what I was searching for, I threw up in my mouth and swallowed it, and grabbed the slippery skin. My plan ended there. What was the next step? Hiding the skin somewhere else didn’t seem good enough. She could find it and disappear forevermore. I had to get rid of it in a more permanent way.

I wrapped the skin around my neck like a scarf and headed back home. There was no one there to stop me from starting a fire in the fireplace. But the skin wouldn’t turn to ash no matter how long I waited…

A light bulb went on in my head. <br>

Sylvie came to my house that afternoon. She was in a state of panic, her beautiful hair a tangled mess. “I can’t find it,” she whispered. “You have to help me.” She confided in me and revealed her secret, even if it wasn’t really a secret anymore. “Let’s go look for it,” she said once her story had concluded. 

I burped. She wrinkled her nose. “Sorry,” I told her while the scent of fish permeated the room. “I ate your skin.”

Her crystalline eyes brimmed with tears as anger consumed her. She swore she was going to destroy everything I loved. And so she did. She broke toys, photos, furniture. She took my guitar, the one dad had given me shortly before he passed away, and smashed it against the wall. She grabbed the vase containing my grandfather's ashes and threw it on the floor. Nothing in my home was left standing except for the two of us. Sylvie walked out without saying another word. Even though guilt jabbed me in the ribs, I wasn't too worried. I began to tidy up the place, confident that Sylvie would forgive me for my little betrayal. Then, we would be friends again, never apart. Such was my wish because I loved her more than anything...

They found her body by the seashore that same night.
