    <h1>When death loves</h1>
    <img src="/img/Skull_card.jpg" alt="">
    <section>
        <p class="shortStories-text">
            She lies naked in the cold embrace of bony arms. Death fingers the inside of her mouth with his right hand, and caresses her breasts with the other one. <br>

            This is different. Felicia doesn't cringe away from his touch as she does with the others. They are always so rough and selfish, but this particular skeleton cares about more than just himself. He cares about her, or so she believes. And hopes. Her job is to please them, so is she breaking an unspoken rule by enjoying every second with him? If she could freeze that moment, she would. <br>
            
            "How many times have you been here?" she asks him when those skeletal fingers are done playing with her tongue. Now they settle on her long dark hair, smooth and silky—as he describes it. <br>
            
            "Five hundred and sixty seven." There is surprise in his voice at the suddenness of her question, yet he doesn't hesitate to answer. <br>
            
            Felicia turns around to face him, her hands settle on his back and she pulls him closer. "All those times with me?" <br>
            
            "All those times with you." <br>
            
            "What about the other women?" <br>
            
            "What about them?" Felicia's brown eyes and Ron's empty eye sockets meet. "I've never been with anyone but you." <br>
            
            "You could choose somebody else, though. Why me?" <br>
            
            Five hundred and sixty seven times in that cramped, fetid room—not that the smell bothered those without a nose. When had she started dreaming of running away with him? It must have been around the first one hundred encounters.
            
            Ron puts his forehead against hers. It's cold, but she doesn't flinch. She never flinches at his touch, but wishes to take as much as possible instead. Does he feel the same way? <br>
            
            "I don't need anybody else," He smiles, and looks far more charming than before. No one else has a smile as bright as that. "I love you, after all." <br>
            
            Those were the words she had been craving for so long, almost as much as grim reapers crave intimacy. Felicia knows that, if he had any flesh to go with that beautiful skull of his, Ron would be blushing, perhaps even more than her. But it's wrong. He's a client. She's not supposed to have feeling for him, nor vice versa. Those things are strictly forbidden. Hell would break loose if someone found out, a punishment could befall them both; something even worse than death. The last person who fell in love with a reaper was put inside a coffin... and there she remains after 980 years, miserable yet unable to pass on. <br>
            
            "What about you?" Ron pulls hers out of those haunting thoughts. "How many reapers have you been with?" <br>
            
            She lost count over a century ago. "Several." He would be frowning had he any brows. Even so, Felicia has learnt to read his expressions. "It's my job." <br>
            
            "Do you like it?" <br>
            
            "Like what?" <br>	
            
            "Your job." <br>
            
            "I hate it." <br>
            
            Ron nods. "I also hate my job." Grim reapers claim humans' souls when their time is due. That's their responsability. "They always cry," he adds. Some time ago, Felicia would have found that statement ludicrous. Why would they cry? She used to want that kind of release more than anything else, but it wasn't possible for her. After she met Ron, nonetheless, immortality become a strange blessing with minor inconveniences. "They beg me not to take them, or to at least let them say goodbye to their loved ones," he goes on. "No one is ever happy to see me because I lead them to the end." <br>
            
            "Death may not be the end," Felicia replies. "Whatever comes next could be even more beautiful than life itself." <br>
            
            "But no one wants to find out." <br>
            
            "Maybe. However, if it's any consolation, I'm always happy to see you." <br>
            
            He goes quiet, patting her on the back. She wonders what the afterlife is like, if it even exists. There might not be anything after the world goes black, but why should she care? Felicia would never get her answer, all because she asked that wicked witch for a spell. She didn't warn her of the consequences. "You are going to lose everything and everyone you care about," the witch should have said. "Your family and friends will leave you alone." <br>
            
            Then, one day, the unexpected happened. Someone, human bones under a black cloak, put her in a cage and took her to their world. Her secret was out: They couldn't kill her. And they liked that. <br>
            
            That's why there are so many like her. It's because grim reapers crave intimacy, they crave touching the living. But when they touch another person, the latter immediately dies, so that pleasure never lasts. It's different with those who are immortal. Grim reapers can get their way, and the living part never fades away.  <br>
            
            In spite of everything, if she had a second chance, she wouldn't do anything different. She met Ron, so it was worth it. <br>
            
            "I don't like it," Ron says after a while. "Other reapers having their way with you. It makes me... What's the word I'm looking for?" <br>
            
            "Jealous?" <br>
            
            He sighs. "Yes, that's right. If we lived inside my fantasy world, you would be free to do whatever you wanted to do, whether that included me or not." <br>
            
            "I'm sure it would."<br>
            
            "Why?" <br>
            
            "Because I love you, too." That confession destroys Ron. He turns into a stuttering mess. She cups his skull on her hands, a grin plastered on her face. "I love you," she repeats, just to mess with the guy. He's so flustered she can't help but laughing. Then, an idea crosses her mind. An idea so dangerous yet mesmerizing, she wonders why it didn't show up before. "Let's do it," she says, and becomes serious again. "We can make your fantasy world a reality." <br>
            
            "What do you mean?" <br>
            
            "Let's run away. We can leave this nightmare and be together, just you and me." <br>
            
            He pulls away and sits on the edge of the bed, on the verge of falling. Ron fidgets under his weight. "That's impossible." <br>
            
            She sits up as well, hands on his shoulders. They are rough to the touch, but it doesn't stop her from planting sweet kisses on them. "Why not?" She kisses the place where his left cheek should be. <br>
            
            "It means breaking the rules. If they find out— I don't want them to hurt you." <br>
            
            "No one will find out. Please, Ron. Look at me. I can't do this anymore. I hate being trapped in here. I want to go anywhere else with you by my side." A kiss over nonexistent lips, she stays there a bit longer than usual. Her mind swirls with thoughts, something to convince him. "Take me with you," she begins, "and you can have me whenever you want. No one else but you." 
            
            He bites the hook as his face shows only interest in the proposal. "I want a real relationship with you," he says. "I want you to be happy." <br>
            
            "Then say yes. Shall we escape?" <br>
            
            He ponders on the question for a few minutes, his head resting on the crook of her neck. Felicia holds him tighter, hoping to squeeze any doubt out of him. Ron shimmers with determination when he jumps out of the bed. 
            
            "Okay!" he says at last. "Let's go." <br>
            
            And so, a grim reapear and an immortal girl run away to find meaning in their eternal lives. Together.
